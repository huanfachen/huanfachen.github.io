I find the following guidelines for using AI Text Generators (e.g. ChatGPT) quite comprehensive, which is from my colleague Thomas.

AI text generators (e.g. ChatGPT) should not be used to produce any original text. All the text in your submission should originate from you, through setting down your own ideas in your own words (supported by relevant quotations from properly cited sources, where appropriate).

The following are acceptable uses of AI for this task:

- Correcting spelling, grammar, syntax: It is fine to give your own text to generative AI software (or indeed, to another person for the purposes of proofreading) and ask it to suggest corrections.
- Generating ideas: It is fine to ask an AI for ideas around your topic and your approach, which you can then go away and explore.
- Help with writing code: It is fine to ask an AI to help you with writing code, either by providing your own code for correction, or by asking for code to achieve a specific goal.

However, you should carefully examine and test any code to which AI has contributed. There is no guarantee that it will do exactly what you request.
