I always forget how to use numerals and units in academic writing - when I should spell out numbers and when I should not. There are general rules and many 'exceptions'. Therefore, I decide to write a blog on this topic.

Note that I will follow the APA style in this blog. The rules of using numerals in Chicago style are quite different, for example, spell out numbers one through one hundred.

# General rule

For values of one through nine, spell out numbers (i.e. use words); for values of 10 and higher, use Arabic numerals.

*Examples:*

The three sites—Taipei, Shanghai, and Bangkok—all experienced severe weather events in the time period studied.

# Exception 0

Use numerals to express units of time, dates, ages, and numbers that denote a specific place in a numbered series.

*Examples:*

... 5 years..., **NOT** ... five years ...

Numerals are often preferable when a number is followed by a unit of measurement.

‘six centimetres’ can also be written as ‘6 cm’

# Exception 1

Always spell out numbers at the beginning of a sentence, if the sentence cannot be rearranged to avoid starting with a number.

*Examples:*

Fifteen days previously… **NOT** 15 days previously…

# Exception 2

For a mixture of numbers in one sentence, use a consistent number style.

*Examples:*

The sample included 34 men with type A blood, 15 with type B, and 3 with type AB.

# Exception 3

Use different number styles when putting two numbers next to each other.

*Examples:*

... five 50-kg women..., **NOT** ... 5 50-kg women...

# Exception 4

Use numerals when the number follows the noun.

*Examples:*

act 7

grade 3

room 9

# Others - Rates, proportions and fractions

- Use a virgule (/) for proportions, and a colon (:) for ratios:
  About 1/3 of samples…
  The ratio was 3:4.5…
  The rate averaged 40/100,000 people…
- Spell out fractions that modify nouns:
  Half the cases showed…
  A two-thirds majority…
- When writing a range or series, give the unit after the final item:
  - **BAD:** 25 mg–30 mg
  - **GOOD:** 25–30 mg
  
- Do not insert a space on either side of an em-dash (—):
  - **BAD:** The three sites — Taipei, Shanghai, and Bangkok — all experienced severe weather events in the time period studied.
  - **GOOD:** The three sites—Taipei, Shanghai, and Bangkok—all experienced severe weather events in the time period studied.
