It is common to see sentences like 'using xxx algorithm as baseline' or 'benchmark against xxx algorithm' in computer science papers. But, what is the specific meaning of benchmark and baseline, and what is the proper usage of these two words?

# benchmark as a noun	

First, benchmark can be used as either a noun or a verb. When used as a noun, it means **a standard for measuring or judging other things of the same type, or something (like share price, interest rate) that things of the same type can be compared against**.

*Examples:*

The benchmark tests show that the new machines are only slightly faster.

# benchmark as a verb

As a verb, *benchmark* means **to measure the quality of sth by comparing it with a standard**, or **to use sth as a standard in order to improve performance**, or **to test the quality of computer software or hardware**.

*Examples:*

The company continues to benchmark against the competition.

Being able to benchmark performance is very important for new companies. (benchmark = measure)

# benchmark vs baseline

While baseline has multiple meaning depending on the context, we use it here to refer to a measurement for comparison.

A **baseline** is a measurement at a point in time.

A **benchmark** is a measurement that is compared to a standard.

For instance, if you want to improve quality of life in a city, you might start by measuring quality of life today. Then, the current observation can be used as a baseline to be compared to future improvements.

Benchmark measurements are used to compare your results to the competition. For example, a city might compare its annual quality of life metrics with those of other cities.

# other meaning of baseline

baseline can also refer to *a minimum level of quality, safety, etc. that is considered to be necessary in a particular situation*.

*Examples:*

Europe's steelmakers have proposed a system that sets a baseline for carbon efficiency.

The new features should provide a baseline of security for Windows users.
