This posts contains a list of recommended books for academic writing, which are particularly tailored for PhD students who are non-native English speakers. These books are classified into two types: **GENERAL** and **GIScience**.

# GENERAL

1. Glasman-Deal, H. (no date) *Science research writing for non-native speakers of English*. London Hackensack: Imperial college press Distributed by World scientific publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

*This book is a handy book for non-native speakers of English, with loads of practical suggestions.*

1. Morley, J. (2023) *Academic phrasebank: an academic writing resource for students and researchers*. 5th edition. [Place of publication not identified]: Amazon.

*The Academic Phrasebank is a general resource for academic  writers. It makes explicit the more  common phraseological ‘nuts and  bolts’ of academic writing. If you are unsure how to write a sentence in abstract or introduction, refer to the relevant section of this book.* 

1. Strunk, W. and White, E.B. (2009) *The elements of style*. 4. ed. [Nachdr.], new ed. New York, Munich: Longman.

*This book is for general writing, beyond academic writing. It covers almost every aspect of writing.*  



# GIScience

1. Longley, P. *et al.* (2015) *Geographic information science and systems*. Third edition. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. (Accessed: 12 December 2018).

*This book, which is informally called Bible of GIS, does not teach how to use ArcGIS or geopandas. Instead, it provides a comprehensive review of GIScience and explains the principle behind every GIScience method in clear and concise language. High recommended.*
