# How to write an Introduction

## Tense pairs

**Present Simple tense** is used in science writing to state accepted facts and truths., but what qualifies as an accepted fact or truth is often your decision. Some research findings have the status of a fact.

```
(a) We found that the pressure increased as the temperature rose, which indicated that temperature played a signifi cant role in the process.
(b) We found that the pressure increases as the temperature rises, which indicates that temperature plays a signifi cant role in the process.
```

In (a), using Past Simple tense means the findings are linked only to your own research, and you do not claim your deductions should be considered as accepted or established facts. In (a), using Present Simple tense means that you believe your findings are strong enough to be considered as facts or truths.

**Present Perfect tense** is used to highlight that the event is considered more relevant to the situation now than **Past Simple tense**.

```
(a) I broke my glasses… (but it doesn't matter/I repaired them)
(b) I have broken my glasses... (and so I can't see properly NOW)

However, although the eff ect of the rubber particles on the mechanical properties of copolymer systems **was demonstrated** over two years ago, little attention **has been paid** to the selection of an appropriate rubber component.
```

## Signalling language

Four ways to connect one sentence or idea to the next: 

* To overlap, meaning to repeat something from the previous sentence:

```
The pattern of inflammation during an asthma attack is different from that seen in **stable asthma**. In **stable asthma** the total number of inflammatory cells does not increase. 
One way to toughen polymers is to incorporate a layer of **rubber** particles. As a result, there has been extensive research regarding the **rubber** modification of PLA.
```

* To use a pronoun (it, they) or pro-form (this method, these systems):

```
Many researchers have suggested ways of reducing cost without affecting the quality of the image. Th ese methods rely on data structures built during a preprocessing step.
On the basis of these criteria it then describes the preparation of a set of polymer blends using PLA and a hydrocarbon rubber (PI). Th is combination of two mechanistically distinct polymerisations formed a novel copolymer in which the incorporation of PI signifi cantly increased fl exibility.
```

* Not to finish the sentence at all, but to join it to the next sentence with a semicolon or a relative clause (a ‘which’ clause). Joining sentences with a semicolon works well when two sentences are very closely related and one of them is quite short.
* To use a **signalling sentence connector** to indicate the relationship between one sentence and the next, or one part of a sentence and the next.
  * CAUSE: due to (the fact that), on account of (the fact that), in view of (the fact that); as; because; since
    * Be careful with *since*: it is also used to mean 'from that time'
    * All these connectors can be used at the start of a sentence
  * RESULT: therefore, as a result, consequently, which is why, hence, so
    *  Don't start sentences with so to communicate a result
  * CONTRAST/DIFFERENCE: however, whereas, but, on the other hand, while, by contrast
    * example: British students are all vegetarians, however Norwegian students eat meat every day.
    * on the contrary and conversely don't fit into this category because they don't only communicate difference; they communicate the fact that 'exactly the opposite is true'. You can't use it in the sentence above, as vegetarians and mean eaters aren't opposites.
    * Be careful when you use while; it is often used to mean 'at that time/at the same time'.
    *
